# Real-Time Bus Tracker
## Tracks the buses between MIT and Harvard in real-time

How to Run:
    -Watch the real-time bus stops between MIT and Harvard
    -The red markers are heading towards Harvard and the blue markers are headed toward MIT
    
Roadmap to future:
    -I live in Milwaukee so I thought I might try to change this to the buses that run between UWMilwaukee and Marquette
